"AI one-shotted me a lot"
- solution: increase AI error ratio in face off

"I was confused by the red triangles, I thought it was the AI's turn
something about this says it's turn based to me"
- "seeing the tail felt like the AIs turn"
- solution: alter face off text

"it wasn't clear that I was hitting the puck out of bounds,
looked like a collision error"
- solution: add additional feedback when puck is hit out of bounds
